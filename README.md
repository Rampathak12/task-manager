Task Manager Application
The Task Manager Application provides a streamlined solution for creating, editing, deleting, filtering, and sorting tasks. Users can easily add tasks by specifying a title, description, and due date. The application features an "Edit" button for modifying existing tasks and a "Delete" button for removing them. Tasks are stored in localStorage, ensuring they persist across sessions. Users can filter tasks by title and due date and sort them either alphabetically or by due date. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this application offers an intuitive interface for efficient task management. 
To use the application, open `index.html` in your browser. Add tasks using the provided input fields, and edit or delete tasks as necessary. Utilize the filter and sort options to keep your tasks organized.
